Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][19] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[W 2] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[20][W 3] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[W 4] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.[W 5]",non_emergency,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,too_long

In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".[35] A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, ""The Decline of Wikipedia"", questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.[36] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.[37] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.""[38] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.[39][40]",non_emergency,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,too_long

There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent.""[55] Varma added, ""While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.""[55] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, ""If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].""[55] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.[56] As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,[57] from which cloud computing was the most cited page.[58]",non_emergency,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,too_long
